<h1>What is happiness?</h1>
<p style="color: rgb(85, 108, 175); font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">I will define happiness as an active state of pleasure and well-being. Happiness is also defined as a cumulative and long-term psychological recognition. I think happiness is temporary because it can happen every moment. It comes fast but loses fast.</p>

<p class="dotted">In my personal life, things about relationships influence my happiness the most. For example, the relationship with my boyfriend or the relationship with my best friend or my family. We are under such a panic recently. I am far away from my home where is in China, So the only close relationship with me is between my friends and my boyfriend.</p>
